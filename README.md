> Assemble plugin for compileing views in a vinyl pipeline.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install assemble-compile-file --save
```

## Usage

**WIP! This is not 100% ready for production use!**

Please feel free to play around with it if you want. Feedback or bug reports welcome.

```js
var compileFile = require('assemble-compile-file');
var assemble = require('assemble');

// register as an instance plugin with assemble
var app = assemble()
  .use(compileFile());

// then use in a vinyl pipeline
app.src('*.hbs')
  .pipe(app.compilefile())
  .pipe(app.dest('foo'));
```

### noop engine

By default, when no engine is found for a file an error is thrown. To get around this you can either define a `noop` engine, or use disable the [engineStrict option](#optionsengineStrict).

A noop engine follows the same signature as any engine, but must be registered using the key: `noop`.

**Example**

```js
app.engine('noop', function(view, opts, next) {
  // do whatever you want to `view`, or nothing
  next(null, view);
});
```

## Options

### options.engineStrict

By default, when no engine is found for a file an error is thrown. This can be disabled with the following:

```js
app.option('engineStrict', false);
```

When disabled and an engine is not found, files are just passed through.
